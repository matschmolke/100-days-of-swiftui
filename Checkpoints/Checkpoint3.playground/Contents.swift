//The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:
// - If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
// - If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
// - If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
// - Otherwise, just print the number.

for i in 1...100 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: 3) && i.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("FizzBuzz")
    } else if i.isMultiple(of: 3) {
        print("Fizz")
    } else if i.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("Buzz")
    } else {
        print(i)
    }
}
